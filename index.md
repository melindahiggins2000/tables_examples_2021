## 25 March 2021 Meeting

As we restart the group we will experiment with a variety of meeting formats. This month we plan to present two topics at about 20 minutes each, followed by an open discussion. Since we will meet via videoconference, we'll limit the meeting to 1 hour to minimize Zoom fatigue.

Please mark your calendar for March 25th from 7:30P - 8:30P ET for our next meeting, where we will share two presentations.
